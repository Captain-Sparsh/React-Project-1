# React-Project-1
This is the first project under 10 React projects from Basic to Advance. This is a basic landing page of a website.

This is a simple page, more like a practice of css. The main aim of this project was to get us familiar with react, it's folder structure and all.
Also we learned how can we make websites from figma files.
